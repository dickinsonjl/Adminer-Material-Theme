# Adminer-Material-Theme

A theme for Adminer inspired the material design language.

[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) is one of the best DB-Magamenet tools out there...

... with the catch that it doesn't look that good.


### Usage
* You'll need [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) itself
* And downlaod the [adminer.css](https://github.com/dickinsonjl/Adminer-Material-Theme/releases/download/v1.2/adminer.css) theme from here
* Put them both in the same web folder - done

### Notes
* Works best in Google Chrome
* Please report render issues
